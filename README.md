agenda_updater
==============

Automatically update google calendar, by scraping events from different sources, eg. from sites without a ical-feed.

Currently Implemented:
-----------------------
- events from KLJIchtegem-site

Todo:
---------------------
- Tidy up by generating a main file that calls functions from both KLJ... as well as google_agenda
- script to add cronjob...
